# Domain 1: Data Ingestion and Transformation (34%)

This domain covers the fundamental concepts and AWS services for ingesting, processing, and transforming data. It represents the largest portion of the exam content.

> **ÔøΩ Teaching Philosophy**: Every concept is explained using real-world examples from supermarkets and banks - places you interact with daily. If you can understand how your grocery store processes your purchase or how your bank handles your transactions, you can understand data engineering!

## üéØ What You'll Master

By completing this domain, you'll understand how to:
- **Collect data** from various sources (like how stores collect sales data)
- **Process data in real-time** (like fraud detection when you swipe your card)
- **Transform data** (like converting raw transaction logs into monthly statements)
- **Orchestrate workflows** (like coordinating all the steps in processing your loan application)
- **Optimize performance** (like making sure your mobile banking app loads instantly)

## üìñ Lesson Structure

Each lesson includes:
- **Real-world scenarios** using supermarket and banking examples
- **Beginner-friendly explanations** with no assumed prior knowledge
- **Visual diagrams** showing data flow and architecture
- **Hands-on examples** you can relate to daily experiences
- **AWS service deep-dives** with practical configurations
