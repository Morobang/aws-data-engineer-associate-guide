# Task Statement 1.1: Perform Data Ingestion

## üéØ What You Need to Know

Data ingestion is about getting data from where it's created into systems where it's useful for business decisions.

### Simple Example: Shoprite's Daily Challenge
When you buy something at Shoprite, that transaction needs to:
- ‚úÖ Update inventory (so they don't oversell)
- ‚úÖ Add loyalty points to your account
- ‚úÖ Help with automatic reordering
- ‚úÖ Feed into sales reports

**That's data ingestion in action!**

## üîÑ Two Main Types

### 1. Real-Time (Streaming)
- **What:** Data flows continuously as events happen
- **When:** Need immediate response (fraud detection, inventory updates)
- **AWS Service:** Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
- **Example:** Credit card fraud detection needs to happen in seconds

### 2. Batch Processing
- **What:** Collect data over time, process all at once
- **When:** Daily/weekly reports, large data analysis
- **AWS Service:** AWS Glue, AWS Batch
- **Example:** End-of-day sales reports for all stores

## üõ†Ô∏è Key AWS Services You Need to Know

### Amazon Kinesis (Real-Time Data)
- **Kinesis Data Streams:** Handle millions of events per second
- **Kinesis Data Firehose:** Automatically deliver data to S3, Redshift
- **When to Use:** Real-time analytics, monitoring, fraud detection

### AWS Glue (Data Processing)
- **What:** Serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service
- **When to Use:** Clean and transform data, scheduled data jobs
- **Benefit:** No servers to manage, pay only when running

### Amazon S3 (Data Storage)
- **What:** Unlimited storage for any type of data
- **Features:** Different storage classes for different access patterns
- **When to Use:** Data lake foundation, backup, archiving

### AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
- **What:** Move data between different database systems
- **When to Use:** Migrating from on-premises to cloud
- **Benefit:** Minimal downtime during migration

## üìä Performance Concepts

### Throughput vs Latency
- **Throughput:** How much data you can process (like checkout lines capacity)
- **Latency:** How fast each individual request gets processed (waiting time per customer)
- **Trade-off:** Sometimes you optimize for one at the expense of the other

### Scaling Patterns
- **Vertical Scaling:** Make one machine more powerful (limited)
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more machines (preferred for big data)

## üéØ Skills You Need

### 1. Choose the Right Ingestion Service
**Real-Time Needs ‚Üí Kinesis**
**Batch Processing ‚Üí Glue**
**Database Migration ‚Üí DMS**

### 2. Configure for Performance
- Set appropriate buffer sizes
- Choose right instance types
- Monitor and adjust based on actual usage

### 3. Handle Errors Gracefully
- Dead letter queues for failed messages
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitoring and alerting

### 4. Optimize Costs
- Choose appropriate storage classes
- Use spot instances where possible
- Schedule batch jobs during off-peak hours

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

1. **Match the tool to the job:** Real-time needs vs batch processing
2. **Start simple:** Begin with basic setups, optimize later
3. **Monitor everything:** Track performance, errors, and costs
4. **Plan for growth:** Design systems that can scale with your business
5. **Focus on reliability:** Data loss is usually worse than slow processing

## üéì Exam Tips

- **Understand service limits** (like Kinesis shard limits)
- **Know cost optimization techniques** (storage classes, spot instances)
- **Memorize common architectures** (streaming vs batch patterns)
- **Practice with real scenarios** (like choosing between Kinesis and SQS)
